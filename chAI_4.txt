Software that interacts with users and performs tasks using AI

A unique identifier used to authenticate requests.

How AI APIs Work in the Backend
Step-by-Step Process of an API Call
User Input – User types a query in a chatbot or selects an option.
Frontend Request – The frontend (HTML/JS) sends an API request with the user input.
Backend Processing – The API:
Validates the request.
Passes input to an AI model.
Generates a response using machine learning models.
Response Returned – The API sends back structured data (usually in JSON format).
Frontend Display – The frontend processes and displays the AI’s response.
