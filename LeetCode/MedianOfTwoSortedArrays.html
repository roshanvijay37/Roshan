    <p><strong>1. Merge and Find Median (O(m + n)):</strong> One straightforward approach is to merge the two sorted arrays into a single array and then find the median. This method has a time complexity of O(m + n), where 'm' and 'n' are the lengths of the two arrays. The process involves merging the arrays and locating the median element or elements in the merged array.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Binary Search on the Smaller Array (O(log(min(m, n)))):</strong> A more optimized approach leverages binary search. The idea is to perform a binary search on the smaller of the two arrays to find a partition such that elements on the left side are smaller than elements on the right side. This ensures that the combined elements on the left and right sides form a valid median. The time complexity of this method is O(log(min(m, n))).</p>
    <p><strong>3. Divide and Conquer (O(log(min(m, n)))):</strong> Another approach employs a divide-and-conquer strategy. The idea is to partition both arrays into two halves such that the number of elements on the left side is equal to the number of elements on the right side. The median is then calculated based on the values at the partition points. This method also has a time complexity of O(log(min(m, n))).</p>
    <p>Choosing the appropriate method depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.</p>
